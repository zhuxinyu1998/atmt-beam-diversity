would you mind spea@@ king more s@@ low@@ ly ?
th@@ ough he is old , he is still e@@ qu@@ al to the t@@ ask .
I really need to talk to you pri@@ v@@ at@@ ely .

B@@ er@@ n@@ ard of Ch@@ ar@@ tres used to say that we are like d@@ war@@ f@@ s on the sh@@ oul@@ der@@ s of gi@@ ants , so that we can see more than they , and things at a gre@@ ater dist@@ ance , not by vir@@ tu@@ e of any sh@@ ar@@ p@@ ness of si@@ ght on our part , or any ph@@ y@@ si@@ cal dist@@ in@@ c@@ tion , but because we are c@@ arried hi@@ gh and r@@ ais@@ ed up by their gi@@ ant si@@ ze .

he is so old that he cannot wal@@ k qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
no arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al col@@ ours , pres@@ er@@ v@@ ati@@ ves or fl@@ av@@ ours .

I was thin@@ king the exac@@ t same thing .

why don &apos;t you star@@ t by tel@@ ling us who went with you ?
have I chang@@ ed that much ?
how much time does the av@@ er@@ age te@@ en@@ ager watch T@@ V every day ?
he knows how to play the piano .
it &apos;s as cold as ice .
I think that I &apos;m just ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ ed .

we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
they dec@@ ei@@ ved us .
which kind of watch do you pre@@ f@@ er , di@@ g@@ ital or an@@ al@@ o@@ g ?
his bad le@@ g pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ed him from win@@ ning the ra@@ ce .
I ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se .
Tom has@@ n &apos;t finished wri@@ ting the re@@ port .

money o@@ pen@@ s all do@@ ors .
I think what you say is true .
there are more B@@ u@@ d@@ d@@ hi@@ sts in Ger@@ many today than people who know how to make a good cho@@ co@@ late c@@ ake .
this bro@@ ken v@@ ase cannot be re@@ p@@ ai@@ red .
there was ab@@ so@@ lu@@ tel@@ y nothing you could do about it .
do you h@@ it your children ?
B@@ ri@@ ti@@ s@@ h people are ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant and ru@@ de .

French is a very beautiful language .
A@@ tom@@ ic en@@ er@@ g@@ y can be uti@@ li@@ z@@ ed for p@@ ea@@ c@@ eful pu@@ r@@ pos@@ es .
I don &apos;t want to be any more bu@@ r@@ d@@ en to my parents .
you can &apos;t do this to yourself .
I have a lot of f@@ low@@ ers .
you must do this alone .
it was qu@@ ite easy for me to car@@ ry the plan out .

O@@ ri@@ ent@@ e@@ er@@ ing re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es ph@@ y@@ si@@ cal f@@ it@@ ness as well as a hi@@ gh l@@ ev@@ el of ment@@ al per@@ form@@ ance .

I thought you said you wor@@ ked here .
this is ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely important .
what &apos;s wrong with those ?
I like wat@@ ching T@@ V .
M@@ on@@ days aren &apos;t good for me .
I was about to leave my house when she called .
the dog bar@@ ks at all str@@ ang@@ ers .
Tom likes ar@@ i@@ th@@ me@@ ti@@ c .
they aren &apos;t du@@ m@@ ber than you .
he makes m@@ oun@@ t@@ ains out of mo@@ le@@ h@@ ill@@ s .
we need to make sure that this is true .
I cannot wh@@ ist@@ le .
Tom was looking at a pic@@ ture of Mary .
we should have told him the truth .
I thought he would be u@@ p@@ set .
the comp@@ any didn &apos;t im@@ me@@ diat@@ ely respon@@ d to re@@ ques@@ ts for comment .

his be@@ ard was th@@ ic@@ k and red .

I want to have se@@ x with her .
I &apos;m not really your friend . I was just pre@@ t@@ end@@ ing .

I compl@@ et@@ ely ap@@ pro@@ ve of this .
that was very ru@@ de .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school yet .
Tom bo@@ il@@ ed some water .
C@@ op@@ y this pro@@ gr@@ am on your com@@ pu@@ ter .
we should pres@@ er@@ ve the beauti@@ es of the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
Sami was l@@ augh@@ ing about that .
it is not you but her that he wants to mar@@ ry .
take a look around you .
this book has a lot of pic@@ tures .
didn &apos;t I tell you not to clo@@ se the door ?
th@@ ank you for invit@@ ing me to dinner .

Tom came up with an in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous idea .
did he for@@ get his money again ?
I &apos;ll never do this again .
these pl@@ ates aren &apos;t c@@ le@@ an .
my bad .
the stu@@ dents di@@ so@@ be@@ y@@ ed their teacher .
there are 1@@ 0 ty@@ p@@ es of people in the world : those who understand b@@ in@@ ary , and those who don &apos;t .
I &apos;m sure of my ri@@ gh@@ ts .
he &apos;s sle@@ ep@@ ing off last night &apos;s b@@ end@@ er .
our bus@@ in@@ ess is exp@@ and@@ ing .
did you try this k@@ ey ?
you are so fu@@ ll of sh@@ it .
a great scho@@ l@@ ar is not n@@ ec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily a good teacher .
the dog is cr@@ un@@ ching a b@@ one .
C@@ re@@ ating Tatoeba was a good idea .
don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
are Tom and Mary sure ?
he &apos;s afraid to d@@ ance .
it &apos;s hard to cho@@ ose .
you &apos;re b@@ lo@@ c@@ king my vie@@ w .
who does your dec@@ or@@ ating ?
I still don &apos;t know what that is .
take me away .
get rich !
I &apos;m looking for@@ ward to sum@@ mer vac@@ ation .
it &apos;s a was@@ te of time and money .
we should have set off ear@@ li@@ er .
she looks very happy .
that &apos;s true for every day exc@@ ep@@ t one .
there is no hope .
Tom has a b@@ right car@@ e@@ er as a me@@ dic@@ al doctor .
even th@@ ough I know a little French , I think we should speak in English .
the no@@ v@@ el has so@@ ld al@@ most 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 co@@ pi@@ es .
what do I me@@ an to you ?
the dog ni@@ p@@ ped at me .
I didn &apos;t want you to get in@@ vol@@ ved .
this problem is difficult to sol@@ ve .
we c@@ le@@ an@@ ed up our room .
we found something .
don &apos;t try the pati@@ ence of G@@ od !
these t@@ ex@@ ts were wri@@ tten in H@@ e@@ bre@@ w , not in A@@ r@@ am@@ ai@@ c .
N@@ e@@ w@@ ton thought the world had been cre@@ ated in 4@@ 0@@ 00 B@@ C .
please per@@ mit me to ask you some questions .
l@@ em@@ ons are s@@ our .
he was too ang@@ ry to speak .
Tom said he &apos;d like to see Mary do that .
the dog is thir@@ st@@ y .
we may as well keep it a secret .
he still lo@@ ves her .
put the e@@ g@@ gs in the fri@@ d@@ ge .
I heard you .
the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y came true .
I don &apos;t feel so spec@@ i@@ al .

how much is this ball ?
make it as sp@@ ic@@ y as you can .
I cri@@ ed .

Tom is re@@ al cu@@ te .
R@@ e@@ peti@@ tion is the mother of all lear@@ ning .
he is not at all a g@@ ent@@ l@@ em@@ an .
he was st@@ and@@ ing at the to@@ p of the m@@ oun@@ tain .
I know Tom is a good ac@@ tor .
you have no need to be as@@ h@@ am@@ ed .
I didn &apos;t know where el@@ se to go .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get a bit of ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se .
I &apos;m tired of e@@ ating at the school caf@@ et@@ er@@ i@@ a .
no one &apos;s wat@@ ching .
he wants a play@@ m@@ ate .
Tom has liv@@ ed here since 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 3 .

sw@@ im@@ ming is good ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se .

Tom seems lost .
Tom couldn &apos;t find the bus stop .
Tom isn &apos;t a stu@@ dent .

I can &apos;t tell you how ang@@ ry that makes me .
is that your own h@@ air ?

who told you Tom was sick ?
th@@ ous@@ and@@ s of people wanted to know the answ@@ er .
do you have enough bl@@ an@@ k@@ ets ?
I wasn &apos;t respon@@ sible .
Mary always stu@@ di@@ es for two hours a day .
she took her time .
he is able to r@@ un f@@ as@@ ter than I am .
that seems like a lot .
Sami didn &apos;t want to be sh@@ am@@ ed in the v@@ illage by his che@@ ating wife .
I know no one in this c@@ ity .
I just wanted cl@@ ar@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ation .
why is in@@ sur@@ ance so important ?

br@@ us@@ h your te@@ et@@ h correc@@ tly before going to bed .
I wasn &apos;t very ath@@ le@@ ti@@ c when I was young .

you &apos;re invit@@ ed .
tell Tom I &apos;ll be there as so@@ on as I can .
Mar@@ ri@@ age is the un@@ ion of a man and woman .
I app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate what you did for me .

do you have any cas@@ h ?
Tom w@@ ouldn &apos;t let any@@ body help him .

I don &apos;t take it pers@@ on@@ ally .
I can &apos;t believe that you aren &apos;t at le@@ ast w@@ ill@@ ing to consi@@ der the pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty of other al@@ tern@@ ati@@ ves .
any play o@@ pen@@ ing to bad re@@ vie@@ ws won &apos;t last long .
I ad@@ mi@@ re your det@@ er@@ min@@ ation .
he took a st@@ ep for@@ ward .
I list@@ en@@ ed to the ra@@ di@@ o while I wor@@ ked .
I don &apos;t want to see her n@@ a@@ ked .

don &apos;t be in such a hur@@ ry .
France , I love you !
she gave me h@@ ell .

why did you let me sleep so late ?

have you put on su@@ n@@ s@@ cre@@ en ?
he seems to have liv@@ ed in S@@ pain .
I heard that she came here .
all of them say so , but I believe n@@ one of them .
you aren &apos;t o@@ bli@@ g@@ ated to come if you don &apos;t want to .
don &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate if you need something .
I can &apos;t find the wai@@ st@@ co@@ at of my three pi@@ e@@ ce su@@ it .
I &apos;ve made up my mind .
he re@@ turned home for the first time in ten years .
I know I have a lot to learn .
I &apos;d like to come home now .
as is often the c@@ ase with her , she didn &apos;t show up on time .
as for me , I am s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed .
I know who I &apos;d re@@ comm@@ end for the job .
I &apos;ve been fol@@ low@@ ing you .
my family isn &apos;t such a big family .
I had a d@@ enti@@ st &apos;s ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment this morning .

you didn &apos;t have to fin@@ ish early .

I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t buy it .
don &apos;t bl@@ ame it on her .
please tea@@ ch me French .
Tom knows he will be p@@ un@@ ished .
she cau@@ ght me off @-@ gu@@ ard .

hab@@ its are difficult to brea@@ k .
I knew we should &apos;ve tried to help Tom .
the first pho@@ to@@ s of the E@@ ar@@ th ta@@ ken from ou@@ ter sp@@ ace cap@@ tu@@ red the imag@@ in@@ ation of an enti@@ re gen@@ er@@ ation .
I &apos;m just a teacher .
never tell li@@ es .
that &apos;s not the only problem .
your fo@@ re@@ h@@ ead is qu@@ ite hot . I think you have a f@@ ever .
I &apos;m so wor@@ n out !
we &apos;re all in this together .
I had no idea there were so many people in the other room .
would you please wait for a few minutes ?
when I got home , I re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed that one of my su@@ it@@ cas@@ es had dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed .
I hope it &apos;s not just a curi@@ o@@ s@@ ity .
have you put on we@@ ight ?
I know what we can do .
I fi@@ gu@@ red that you &apos;d be im@@ pr@@ ess@@ ed .
he ar@@ gu@@ es that the ad@@ min@@ is@@ tr@@ ation must look for al@@ tern@@ ati@@ ve s@@ our@@ ces of re@@ ven@@ ue .
look out for ro@@ ck s@@ li@@ des .
everyone thin@@ ks we &apos;re a cou@@ ple .
this tel@@ e@@ phone is out of or@@ der .

P@@ r@@ ay for all of us .
that would be w@@ ic@@ ked !
you don &apos;t have to be a vi@@ c@@ ti@@ m .
I &apos;m good at play@@ ing the piano .
I won &apos;t tell you why I did that .
the st@@ or@@ m did great d@@ am@@ age to her pro@@ per@@ ty .
how much is the ex@@ pr@@ ess ?
P@@ in@@ ea@@ p@@ ple is rich in c@@ it@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id .
she has good sen@@ se .

is that thing working ?
just as I thought something was ru@@ st@@ ling there , a cat l@@ ea@@ ped out of the bus@@ h .
we want a rem@@ at@@ ch .
I can &apos;t come and see you every day .
I can read your mind .
when we look at other pl@@ ac@@ es in the uni@@ ver@@ se , it could very well be that pho@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c life is the exc@@ ep@@ tion .
I have no idea what he has in mind , re@@ j@@ ec@@ ting such a f@@ av@@ or@@ able propos@@ al .
&quot; so , you &apos;ll go out with me if I don &apos;t have to re@@ pe@@ at a year ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care for &apos; what if &apos; sto@@ ri@@ es . &quot;
he went ab@@ o@@ ard the plan@@ e .

don &apos;t tell Tom about what we plan to do next wee@@ k@@ end .
I know you &apos;re tired , but w@@ ake up !
to make mat@@ ters wor@@ se , it beg@@ an to rain .
a mo@@ tel is like a ho@@ tel only much sm@@ aller and is used mo@@ st@@ ly by people trav@@ el@@ ing by au@@ tom@@ o@@ bi@@ le .
I believe this is mine .
j@@ ack is b@@ ound to succ@@ e@@ ed this time .
I can &apos;t sol@@ ve this problem .
what &apos;s your be@@ e@@ f ?
sol@@ der@@ ing S@@ M@@ T com@@ pon@@ ents re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es a bit more ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence than sol@@ der@@ ing th@@ rough @-@ ho@@ le com@@ pon@@ ents .
Tom is a nat@@ ur@@ al ath@@ le@@ te .
Tom is t@@ all , but not as t@@ all as I am .
show us the str@@ ai@@ ght p@@ ath .
ten years is a long time to wait .
I didn &apos;t hear a s@@ pl@@ as@@ h .
do you have a p@@ en ?
I &apos;m very interes@@ ted in the ev@@ o@@ lution of the din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs .
you &apos;re the most beautiful woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
she was hor@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed .
she made me hur@@ ry .
I don &apos;t see how that is any of your bus@@ in@@ ess .
I was car@@ eful to not leave any ev@@ id@@ ence .
Tom tried to che@@ er Mary up .
get it out of the house .
I &apos;d heard you &apos;d chang@@ ed .
prom@@ ise me you won &apos;t tell her .
I h@@ it my h@@ ead and saw star@@ s .
it occu@@ red to me that my senten@@ ces may never be trans@@ l@@ ated .
I think that she &apos;s hi@@ ding something .
I &apos;m sure Tom will leave early .
it was not my in@@ ten@@ tion .
she didn &apos;t want to think about it .
Tom nee@@ ds lo@@ ts of cour@@ age and pers@@ ever@@ ance because he has to pay attention to so many things at the same time .
the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake sm@@ as@@ hed everything .
why is Mary going for a pic@@ ni@@ c with him ?
keep Tom s@@ af@@ e .
I should &apos;ve list@@ en@@ ed to you .
it is very f@@ ine today .
I know Tom &apos;s not happy there .
I was ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ ed .
I just think you should be car@@ eful , that &apos;s all .
it b@@ el@@ on@@ gs to my brother .
I think I know what this is .
I want a lic@@ en@@ sed gu@@ ide who spea@@ ks English .
what &apos;s wrong with those ?
don &apos;t inter@@ f@@ ere in oth@@ ers &apos; af@@ fai@@ rs .
I &apos;m not good at dr@@ aw@@ ing .
I don &apos;t like s@@ car@@ y mo@@ vi@@ es .

in char@@ ity there is no exc@@ ess .
you &apos;re a s@@ no@@ b .
ready , ro@@ ck @-@ pap@@ er @-@ s@@ c@@ is@@ sor@@ s ! it &apos;s a dr@@ a@@ w !
she tre@@ ated him like a king .
I think you &apos;ve already met her .
does he go to school by bus ?
he fel@@ t it was his du@@ ty to go .
I &apos;m qu@@ ite happy .
I &apos;d really ra@@ ther be alone right now .
I wanted you to w@@ in .
I know who he is .
there is no hur@@ ry .
you d@@ ead .
I called her , but the l@@ ine was busy .
today is not so cold .
I really like this one .
they found out .
we c@@ li@@ m@@ bed right up to the to@@ p .
Tom knows why Mary dec@@ i@@ ded not to go on the pic@@ ni@@ c with him .
we &apos;ve had no compl@@ ain@@ ts .
O@@ s@@ car was my mu@@ m &apos;s dog .
it al@@ most s@@ car@@ ed me not to see you on@@ l@@ ine for a wh@@ ole day .
car@@ s are ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve .

Tom put on some clo@@ th@@ es .
par@@ don me , but that is my r@@ ac@@ k@@ et .
I &apos;m Tom by the way .
that &apos;s too hard .
she dri@@ ed her t@@ ears .
he took the w@@ o@@ od and sa@@ w@@ ed it us@@ ing the saw .
Tom tal@@ ked too much and let the secret s@@ li@@ p .
why did you come home so late ?
he be@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed you .
I can &apos;t see it .
don &apos;t talk to me about r@@ eli@@ gi@@ on .
Sami liv@@ ed very clo@@ se to the lo@@ c@@ ation where L@@ ay@@ la &apos;s body was found .

her brother is one of my good friends .
I fin@@ ally found out what was wrong with my T@@ V .

I have to get to school .
I need some su@@ g@@ ar to make a c@@ ake .

she vo@@ lun@@ te@@ er@@ ed to go to the meeting with him .
I like mil@@ k .
you must not stop on the hard sh@@ oul@@ der to go to the to@@ il@@ et .
I probab@@ ly should have said something .
Tom k@@ illed a man .
it was a g@@ am@@ ble .
they came last week .
I haven &apos;t used An@@ k@@ i in a week and now I have 5@@ 00 fl@@ as@@ h@@ car@@ ds du@@ e .

the accident took place at a cro@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ad@@ s .
I must br@@ us@@ h up my English .
do you like hor@@ ro@@ r mo@@ vi@@ es ?
she always exp@@ ec@@ ts me to help her .
you are probab@@ ly wrong .
don &apos;t speak so fast .
because there are a lot of vol@@ can@@ o@@ es , it is easy for Jap@@ an to be h@@ it by ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ kes .
I s@@ li@@ p@@ ped on an ic@@ y p@@ at@@ ch .

Tom sho@@ w@@ ed Mary my pic@@ ture .
I gave my brother a dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary .
she came to her sen@@ ses in ho@@ sp@@ ital .
I read anger in her face .
I &apos;m too tired to go out jo@@ gg@@ ing .
the dis@@ cre@@ p@@ anc@@ y bet@@ we@@ en the sto@@ ri@@ es of the two parti@@ es in@@ vol@@ ved in the accident was so great that the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ti@@ es had a hard time dec@@ i@@ ding which side was tel@@ ling the truth .
you don &apos;t need to wor@@ ry anymore .
I think it will be su@@ n@@ n@@ y tomorrow .
she &apos;s two years youn@@ ger than him .
a sp@@ ell of f@@ ine wea@@ ther en@@ ab@@ led us to get the har@@ v@@ est in s@@ af@@ ely .
Tom told Mary he &apos;d never lie to her .
he asked her out on a d@@ ate .
I want to go out ton@@ ight .
she doesn &apos;t want him to pic@@ k the f@@ low@@ ers .

she was very ne@@ ar@@ ly r@@ un over by a tru@@ ck .
this is the first time I &apos;ve ever sw@@ e@@ ated so much .
I &apos;d like to meet Tom .
there are many w@@ il@@ d anim@@ al@@ s in this ar@@ e@@ a .
that &apos;s pre@@ tty much all you need to know .
he was where Tom said he would be .
which came first , the ch@@ ic@@ ken or the e@@ g@@ g ?
Tom is still ang@@ ry .
I was cho@@ s@@ en to do that .
if Tom were t@@ aller , he could open the door .
was any@@ body here while I was out ?
everything was difficult .
as scienti@@ sts keep in@@ sist@@ ing , there is nei@@ ther good no@@ r bad in any scienti@@ fi@@ c dis@@ co@@ very .
my gr@@ ade is ab@@ o@@ ve the av@@ er@@ age .
this isn &apos;t where I par@@ ked my car .

I want to war@@ m myself .
I told you not to come here .

three children were play@@ ing in the par@@ k .
P@@ ee@@ ing s@@ it@@ ting down is not all that bad .

who is bor@@ n to be h@@ ang@@ ed will never be dro@@ w@@ ned .
you should call for a doctor .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him to c@@ at@@ ch the first train in the morning .
she heard him sing .
I don &apos;t have a pass@@ port .

I know that Tom might want to learn how to do that .
it &apos;s not qu@@ ite as difficult to do as it s@@ oun@@ ds .
if you want to mar@@ ry my d@@ augh@@ ter , you should resp@@ ect our family tr@@ adi@@ tions .
they love coffee .
I can &apos;t go out because I have a lot of hom@@ e@@ work .
she cri@@ ed b@@ it@@ ter@@ ly .
I can &apos;t play tennis as well as I used to .
our t@@ ask has been easy so far , but it will be difficult from now on .

she didn &apos;t show up .
I &apos;ll come back .
Tom pre@@ t@@ end@@ ed he had a g@@ un .

my house fac@@ es the se@@ a .

I did it without you .
T@@ V pl@@ ays an important part in every@@ day life .

my mother told me I nee@@ ded to eat less c@@ and@@ y .

I think that fac@@ t is very important .
the do@@ gs are in the gar@@ d@@ en .

when we st@@ ep@@ ped off the bus we were im@@ me@@ diat@@ ely sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a th@@ r@@ ong of children from the v@@ illage .
I have to say that there &apos;s no better place to s@@ pend my hon@@ ey@@ mo@@ on than G@@ and@@ r@@ ange !

I didn &apos;t understand .
the love of li@@ b@@ er@@ ty br@@ ought us here .

set Tom free .
I &apos;m in love .
it looks like a du@@ ck .
they need him .
I &apos;m s@@ mar@@ ter than you .
she was h@@ it by a car .
I s@@ at at the b@@ ar .
children often do stupi@@ d things .
take off your h@@ at when you come into a room .
let me jo@@ in your cause .
Tom was u@@ p@@ st@@ ai@@ rs .
I didn &apos;t know they were d@@ ating .
I want a doctor .
do not fe@@ ed the du@@ c@@ ks .
what direc@@ tion are you going ?
French isn &apos;t all that difficult to learn .
the sk@@ y is cl@@ ear . not a cl@@ ou@@ d in si@@ ght .

my work is not compl@@ e@@ te yet .
could you ad@@ d me ?

I don &apos;t need an answ@@ er right now .
what &apos;s the t@@ all@@ est bu@@ il@@ ding in Boston ?
I had no idea who she was .
you &apos;re the only person I know who can help me .
I know you aren &apos;t a doctor .
if they w@@ ish to des@@ tro@@ y their lun@@ gs .@@ ..
if I knew his ad@@ dress , I would get in tou@@ ch with him right away .
they were att@@ ac@@ ked .
I asked him not to bo@@ ther me .
I hate this part of the mo@@ vie .
do you have a bo@@ ttle o@@ pen@@ er I could use ?
I hate bl@@ ack hu@@ mo@@ r .
most of them ur@@ g@@ ed him to take the job .
he didn &apos;t do that out of me@@ an@@ ness , but ra@@ ther out of ab@@ sent @-@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness .
they can speak Ger@@ man .
how do you plan on pay@@ ing for that ?
is your wife a good co@@ ok ?
what do you think happened to Tom ?
E@@ ar@@ th is the thir@@ d plan@@ et from the su@@ n .
I don &apos;t have time to say this t@@ wi@@ ce , so list@@ en car@@ e@@ fu@@ l@@ ly .
Tom wasn &apos;t w@@ ear@@ ing sho@@ es .

there is a pon@@ d in the mi@@ d@@ d@@ le of the par@@ k .
I &apos;m feel@@ ing low .
he &apos;s a re@@ be@@ l .
here we are .
it &apos;s more interes@@ ting to trav@@ el alone than to go on a gr@@ ou@@ p tour .
seen from a dist@@ ance , it looks like a ball .
even if it co@@ sts 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 y@@ en , I must buy the dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary .
I &apos;m r@@ ar@@ ely invit@@ ed to parti@@ es .
ex@@ cu@@ se me , but I think this is my se@@ at .
I can &apos;t for@@ give him for be@@ having like that .
that &apos;s where I work .
I can tea@@ ch you something .
do you den@@ y that you went there ?
there &apos;s no need to be ru@@ de .
Tom rec@@ ei@@ ved a t@@ ext m@@ ess@@ age .
let &apos;s play a g@@ ame of bl@@ ind man &apos;s bu@@ f@@ f .

F@@ ill out the ques@@ tionn@@ aire .

I &apos;ll go first .
sci@@ ence will not sol@@ ve all of our probl@@ ems .

please cho@@ ose a str@@ on@@ ger pass@@ word .
I didn &apos;t take the time to do it pro@@ per@@ ly .
the leav@@ es of the tre@@ es have turned red .
we had to stop .
he gave the im@@ pres@@ sion of having much money .
remember that .
the ro@@ ad was b@@ lo@@ c@@ ked by fall@@ en ro@@ c@@ ks .

Sami knows this ho@@ od like the back of his hand .
if only I &apos;d h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t st@@ ay@@ ed so long !
Tom didn &apos;t come to the last meeting .
H@@ on@@ es@@ tly , Tom , I can &apos;t remember . it was more than 1@@ 0 years ag@@ o .

the nei@@ gh@@ b@@ ours are ma@@ king too much no@@ ise - they &apos;re star@@ ting to an@@ no@@ y me !
I &apos;ve already dr@@ un@@ k h@@ al@@ f a bo@@ ttle of w@@ ine while I was waiting for you .

Tom has can@@ cel@@ ed his tri@@ p .
I &apos;m ou@@ tr@@ ag@@ ed !

I couldn &apos;t b@@ ear to look at her .
I had to keep us am@@ used with to@@ ys .
I got there a@@ h@@ ead of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see you .
Tom sho@@ w@@ ed Mary the ro@@ p@@ es .
he was sur@@ pri@@ sed too .

am I di@@ stu@@ r@@ b@@ ing something ?
W@@ ill@@ in@@ gn@@ ess to correc@@ t is an in@@ dic@@ ation of w@@ is@@ d@@ om .
H@@ ey , don &apos;t do that !
I think Tom is cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous .
when did you get there ?
he &apos;s a hun@@ k .
no one believ@@ ed you .
I &apos;m ad@@ dic@@ ted to ni@@ co@@ t@@ ine .
Tom didn &apos;t think he &apos;d ever get used to T@@ h@@ ai food .
he has a sh@@ or@@ t attention sp@@ an .
I &apos;m sup@@ er hun@@ gr@@ y .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;d want to live here .
they were not im@@ pr@@ ess@@ ed .
she is nothing to him .
we need to find out who he is and who he &apos;s working for .
do not di@@ stu@@ r@@ b her .
she turned her eyes away .
this ty@@ pe of person is bor@@ ing .
I bu@@ il@@ t this do@@ gh@@ ouse by myself .

S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x was un@@ kno@@ wn to N@@ ati@@ ve A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans .

show no mer@@ c@@ y .
I thought you &apos;d want to see this mo@@ vie .
bo@@ th Tom and Mary smo@@ ke .
I &apos;d like you to it@@ em@@ i@@ ze the char@@ g@@ es .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary &apos;s last name was .
this is y@@ ours , isn &apos;t it ?
where do you live in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey ?
you should have been more car@@ eful .
he f@@ an@@ ci@@ es himself ill .
she is not as@@ h@@ am@@ ed of her mis@@ condu@@ c@@ t .
we will vis@@ it our teacher next week .
she likes no one and no one likes her .
we &apos;re finished already .
if only you &apos;d thought of that before sho@@ o@@ ting your big mou@@ th off .
did you see him go out ?
the doctor tre@@ ated her in@@ ju@@ ry .
I think Tom e@@ ats too much me@@ at .
life is too sh@@ or@@ t , really !
I &apos;m not sure what to say .
do you really want to w@@ in ?
I have enough money to buy a car .
let &apos;s keep an ey@@ e on this .
the teacher al@@ low@@ ed him to go home .
why didn &apos;t you read the mag@@ az@@ ine ?

I can &apos;t be mani@@ pul@@ ated .
please feel free to make su@@ gg@@ es@@ tions .
can you sup@@ pl@@ y me with all I need ?
I know Tom is all right now .
K@@ o@@ al@@ as are cu@@ te .

they want more sp@@ ace .
those are your op@@ tions .
if all el@@ se fai@@ ls , re@@ boo@@ t the sy@@ st@@ e@@ m .

Tom was m@@ au@@ led by a dog when he was a k@@ id .

M@@ enn@@ ad is a ro@@ b@@ ber .

you might want to take a look at this .
our first d@@ ate was kind of aw@@ k@@ ward . I was really ner@@ vous .
the sho@@ p was clo@@ sed .
I sh@@ all need a w@@ o@@ ol bl@@ an@@ k@@ et because it is cold at night .
I &apos;m lu@@ ck@@ y to have you as a friend .

they tre@@ ated her so cr@@ u@@ el@@ ly as to leave few jo@@ ys in life for her .
I just e@@ cho@@ ed his opinion .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to the concer@@ t because he had to work .
it &apos;s a qu@@ ar@@ ter to two .
you must not go out at night .
I sur@@ viv@@ ed .
we &apos;re vo@@ lun@@ te@@ er@@ ing .

they never talk but they qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l .
he liv@@ ed alone in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
A@@ h , when will they meet again ?
I &apos;m not tired right now .

I have questions .
it &apos;s hard to understand you .

everything &apos;s going to work out .
Tom doesn &apos;t ag@@ ree with you .
his secre@@ t@@ ary seems to know the truth .
the cri@@ min@@ al is sure to do time for ro@@ b@@ b@@ ing the sto@@ re .
why can &apos;t I see you ?
this is ser@@ i@@ ous , Tom .
I have three times more books than he has .
they went on a tri@@ p ab@@ ro@@ ad for the first time .
we won@@ der why .
do you want something cold to drink ?
I &apos;m re@@ gu@@ lar@@ ly feel@@ ing down in the du@@ m@@ ps .
why is she so popul@@ ar ?

in my opinion , he is correc@@ t .

there &apos;s no question of bo@@ t@@ ching this job . it must be done well .
do you work here ?
she always ur@@ g@@ es him to try new things .
c@@ lear@@ ly , this is the most important point .
I study English every day .
I can &apos;t help myself .
you should have spo@@ ken more poli@@ tel@@ y .
I have never been to that to@@ wn .
I want to be more than friends .
you ought to be qui@@ et in a li@@ br@@ ary .
did you see any@@ body there ?
she made a tour of A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a , st@@ op@@ ping in six ci@@ ti@@ es .
Sami might come home for a cou@@ ple of days .
why am I hun@@ gr@@ y ?
how did they find out ?
do you really think Tom is better than I am ?
that doesn &apos;t wor@@ ry me at all .
who do you like better , S@@ ach@@ i@@ k@@ o or A@@ k@@ i@@ k@@ o ?

L@@ ay@@ la never w@@ ears ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p .
everyone &apos;s there .
I don &apos;t think this is a good idea .

I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ ze you .
why don &apos;t you talk to her ?
no one read@@ s my b@@ lo@@ g .
I think it &apos;s danger@@ ous to c@@ li@@ m@@ b that m@@ oun@@ tain alone .
I want you to get out of to@@ wn .
you &apos;re not thin@@ king c@@ lear@@ ly .
he had never for@@ gi@@ v@@ en A@@ dé@@ la@@ ï@@ de for not having those he@@ av@@ y bre@@ as@@ ts , those wi@@ de bu@@ t@@ to@@ c@@ ks that are a cre@@ dit to fam@@ ili@@ es .
you don &apos;t have the right .

everyone is waiting for her .
I can understand that .
where is the bus stop ?
Tom apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ z@@ ed .

no one is so old but he can learn .

we want nat@@ ur@@ al @-@ s@@ oun@@ ding trans@@ l@@ ations , not word @-@ for @-@ word direc@@ t trans@@ l@@ ations .
I didn &apos;t even know you spo@@ ke French .
they who dre@@ am by day are co@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ ant of many things which es@@ cap@@ e those who dre@@ am only by night .
the scienti@@ sts have not found any ex@@ plan@@ ation for the my@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ ous ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
it &apos;s too su@@ n@@ n@@ y to stay in@@ side .

Tom has so@@ ld his house in Boston .
Tom always had to w@@ in .

people make mist@@ a@@ kes in a situation like this .
I &apos;ll tell him that .
Mary has for@@ go@@ tten her u@@ m@@ br@@ el@@ la in some bus .
no , no , no !
Tom was long consi@@ der@@ ed an in@@ vin@@ ci@@ ble w@@ arri@@ or .
P@@ en@@ ance is one of the s@@ even s@@ ac@@ r@@ am@@ ents .
she has a small bl@@ ack dog .
they p@@ us@@ hed him out of the windo@@ w .
I don &apos;t like your s@@ mi@@ le .
&quot; th@@ ank you . &quot; &quot; you &apos;re w@@ el@@ come . &quot;
you do like liv@@ ing danger@@ ous@@ ly .
you never get a secon@@ d chance to make a first im@@ pres@@ sion .
seen from a dist@@ ance , the h@@ ill looks like an el@@ e@@ ph@@ ant .
I had a terri@@ ble dre@@ am .
this sw@@ an is bl@@ ack .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was afraid of g@@ ho@@ sts .
is that all you want to know ?
do you think he &apos;s sen@@ sible ?
we need a str@@ at@@ e@@ g@@ y .
he has wri@@ tten a letter .
you should get ri@@ d of that bad hab@@ it .
I went to don@@ ate b@@ lo@@ od today .

can you dri@@ ve man@@ u@@ al ?
are you th@@ rough with your work ?
how much did you pay for him ?
sel@@ ling car@@ s is my job .
he ta@@ kes on himself to direc@@ t the A@@ l@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty what to do , even in the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment of the uni@@ ver@@ se .
I did it in a hur@@ ry .
I won &apos;t do that un@@ less you want me to .
I w@@ ish to speak to you .
the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en is not a su@@ it@@ able place for ar@@ gu@@ m@@ ents . too many k@@ ni@@ ves .
you didn &apos;t make it cl@@ ear .
I am not in@@ sol@@ ent to@@ war@@ ds them .

we lost on that job .
I &apos;d take it if I were you .

didn &apos;t your parents tea@@ ch you anything ?

he hi@@ d be@@ h@@ ind the door .
the gl@@ ass is fu@@ ll of water .
today , I got up very early .
I app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate anything you can do .
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers say that it &apos;s eas@@ ier to lo@@ se we@@ ight if you eat three s@@ qu@@ are me@@ al@@ s a day .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
you know nothing of the world .
I didn &apos;t k@@ ill anyone .
I &apos;m not g@@ onn@@ a do anything about it .
I wor@@ ked hard all day long yesterday .
always .
I want you to keep your prom@@ ise .
Tom is b@@ le@@ e@@ ding .

he has money .
it r@@ ains a lot in J@@ une .
the a@@ ar@@ d@@ v@@ ar@@ k is a me@@ di@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed anim@@ al .
you could do this if you put your mind to it .
you make my day so much bri@@ gh@@ ter .
she can &apos;t find her k@@ ey@@ s .
Tom is p@@ ac@@ king .
I ad@@ mit that at first I didn &apos;t like you .
you should resp@@ ect the ru@@ les your parents set for you .

you should not resp@@ ect a man because he is rich .
the ru@@ mo@@ r turned out true .
I thought you &apos;d be t@@ aller .

she called him every other day .
Tom is a bit str@@ ange .
b@@ ill , call me ton@@ ight .
there is no time to lo@@ se : my t@@ est is tomorrow .

you &apos;d better not wait here .
I often go to the se@@ a .
this morning the wea@@ ther is cl@@ ou@@ dy .
do you have any idea what Tom was doing in Boston ?
you won &apos;t stay , will you ?
my father bought me a bicy@@ cle .
she is dr@@ un@@ k with happ@@ in@@ ess .
are there any ban@@ an@@ as ?
Tom said Mary was happy .
win@@ ter is s@@ now time .
what cr@@ a@@ p ! your ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant comm@@ ents aren &apos;t just us@@ el@@ ess but al@@ so a pain in the ar@@ se .
that &apos;s another matter .
do you really want to help ?
do you think Tom is gu@@ il@@ ty ?
some say that I@@ s@@ ra@@ el should be bo@@ y@@ co@@ t@@ ted for its a@@ par@@ the@@ id sy@@ st@@ e@@ m .
he dri@@ ves a tru@@ ck .

Tom and Mary are b@@ ac@@ k@@ p@@ ac@@ k@@ ers .

M@@ r S@@ m@@ ith tea@@ ches me English .
I plan to go to her co@@ ck@@ tai@@ l party .
she cau@@ ght si@@ ght of a ro@@ w@@ ing bo@@ at in the dist@@ ance .
Tom was very ang@@ ry with me .
he is kno@@ wn to everyone in the v@@ illage .
this isn &apos;t sup@@ pos@@ ed to be hap@@ pen@@ ing .
I think it &apos;s time for me to was@@ h my car .
I told her to come vis@@ it us .
he was too young to go to school .
if a man had 1@@ 1 sh@@ ee@@ p and all but 9 died , how many sh@@ ee@@ p would he have left ?
these lo@@ des may pro@@ ve rich enough to be prof@@ it@@ ab@@ ly min@@ ed .
would you like to try it again ?
do you write in French ?
don &apos;t take any no@@ ti@@ ce of what he s@@ ays .
it &apos;s on the so@@ f@@ a .
I even w@@ ro@@ te a letter to her .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
I found a bir@@ d wh@@ ose w@@ ing was s@@ ever@@ ely d@@ am@@ ag@@ ed .
the poli@@ c@@ em@@ an sho@@ t into the air .
I won@@ der wh@@ e@@ ther a man could live with only two hours &apos; sleep a night .

father is ang@@ ry with me .
I sy@@ m@@ p@@ ath@@ i@@ ze .
do you think you can get me out of here ?
don &apos;t for@@ get to s@@ end that letter .
I didn &apos;t tell anyone .
I thought she was stupi@@ d .
they told me that they in@@ t@@ end@@ ed to w@@ in .
they set out for N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k .
did you take the money ?
we had to l@@ ess@@ en the im@@ p@@ act of the er@@ r@@ ati@@ c sup@@ p@@ li@@ es .
don &apos;t cut your fin@@ ger .
the situation is very comp@@ lic@@ ated .
I &apos;ve got a br@@ and new bi@@ ke .
she went in@@ side .
what will the nei@@ gh@@ b@@ ors think ?
I like that kind of stu@@ f@@ f .
she wri@@ tes with her left hand .
my house is next to the big t@@ ree .
the w@@ o@@ od was very d@@ ar@@ k , and she could not help t@@ rem@@ bl@@ ing from f@@ ear .
she had nothing to do with it .
I want to , but I can &apos;t .
here he com@@ es .
Tom , I &apos;m happy for you .
I can get us there more qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
I had a prom@@ ise to keep .
I was ev@@ en@@ tu@@ ally rel@@ eas@@ ed .
today , I am happ@@ ier than ever .

at that time , bicy@@ c@@ les were just star@@ ting to get popul@@ ar and , here and there , there were many un@@ sk@@ illed beg@@ in@@ n@@ ers who r@@ an into people and bro@@ ke th@@ rough their he@@ d@@ g@@ es .
I might be back before you leave .
U@@ n@@ believ@@ able !

I have gr@@ ap@@ es .
I &apos;m aw@@ are of the d@@ anger .
buy f@@ our big po@@ t@@ ato@@ es for me .
I did everything I could do .
it &apos;s not sup@@ pos@@ ed to be this way .
te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers are G@@ od &apos;s p@@ un@@ is@@ h@@ ment for having se@@ x .
she was sick .
it is two o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the morning .
everything seems con@@ fus@@ ing .
I can &apos;t go out .
I sing the s@@ ong of him wh@@ ose bre@@ ad I eat .
the last thing I want to do is cause you any more pain .
I b@@ et you &apos;re feel@@ ing really good right now .
which book is better ?
Tom looks at her without s@@ ay@@ ing anything .
I won@@ der if it really was a co@@ in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence .
this is a sen@@ si@@ tive is@@ su@@ e .
I &apos;m thin@@ king of chang@@ ing jo@@ b@@ s .
use all your str@@ en@@ g@@ th .
there were no fen@@ ces on the great pl@@ ains .
can you turn off the light ?
m@@ ea@@ sure t@@ wi@@ ce , cut once .
I could &apos;ve married Tom .
she doesn &apos;t like so@@ c@@ c@@ er .
my brother de@@ p@@ ends on me for money .
Tom makes big money .
are you going to s@@ ave us ?
it &apos;s in the fri@@ d@@ ge .
do it this way .
he took back what he had said about her .
that &apos;s it . I &apos;ve done all I can do .
come and keep me comp@@ any .
I really miss you .
I don &apos;t ag@@ ree with the the@@ ory that one should learn L@@ ati@@ n in or@@ der to better understand English .
the sh@@ ap@@ e of the ro@@ of looks like a p@@ y@@ r@@ am@@ id .
I bought a watch and an em@@ p@@ ty bo@@ x .
tell Tom .
I read .
I think it &apos;s danger@@ ous for children to s@@ wi@@ m in this l@@ ake .
I thought you were my friend .
he will so@@ on be p@@ ast play@@ ing with to@@ ys .
B@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on was fam@@ ous for its h@@ ang@@ ing gar@@ d@@ ens .

there was a par@@ ade to mar@@ k the oc@@ cas@@ ion .
Tom is not a true w@@ arri@@ or .
he is very cl@@ ever for a boy of ten .

since the no@@ te was wri@@ tten in French , it was easy for me to read .
I can &apos;t believe you ac@@ tu@@ ally did something like that .

I &apos;d like to get married .

the ch@@ air cre@@ a@@ ked as he s@@ at down .
I believe she &apos;s 4@@ 0 years old .
I &apos;m a busy person .
Tom couldn &apos;t do something like that .
do you mind if I watch T@@ V for a while ?

you know where to find me .
the respon@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty is mine .
we &apos;ll do the same for you .
it was not a compl@@ e@@ te vi@@ c@@ t@@ ory .
something is s@@ low@@ ing down my com@@ pu@@ ter .
I had no place el@@ se to go .
I can &apos;t igno@@ re that .
I want to apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze to all of you for what just happened .
I want a don@@ ut .
she is more char@@ ming that the oth@@ ers .
the vo@@ te is un@@ anim@@ ous .
I can &apos;t imag@@ ine my life without Tom .
there were a lot of girls at the party .
I w@@ ish I could ex@@ pl@@ ain to you how important this is to me .
there &apos;s a lot of tr@@ aff@@ ic today .
I &apos;ve read the book in one go .

Tom is b@@ it@@ ing his n@@ ai@@ ls .
Tom was like a brother to me .
you aren &apos;t the eas@@ i@@ est person to live with .
Tom never gi@@ ves anything to any@@ body .
if the spec@@ t@@ at@@ ors made fun of the other tea@@ m , th@@ en it would wea@@ ken their mor@@ ale .
correc@@ t me if I am wrong .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do with you .

he wants you to come home .
I &apos;m not a per@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ on@@ ist .

I never wanted this .
