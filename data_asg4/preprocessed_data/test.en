it is on this point that our opin@@ ions diff@@ er .
th@@ ank you for your concer@@ n .
he likes wal@@ king in the par@@ k .

I saw him cro@@ s@@ sing the ro@@ ad .

you were s@@ car@@ ed , w@@ er@@ en &apos;t you ?
do you have a se@@ c ?
j@@ ack was too l@@ azy to give them a call , so they dec@@ i@@ ded to wal@@ k without him .
I want to eat you .

he had dinner by himself .
this is something I must face alone .
I succ@@ ee@@ ded in getting the book .
they have what they want .
it doesn &apos;t b@@ el@@ ong to you .
what &apos;s the wea@@ ther like where you are ?
you &apos;re too old for me .
she looks as if she &apos;s l@@ augh@@ ing to her@@ self .
I inter@@ pre@@ ted what he said in French into Jap@@ an@@ ese .
is it your bi@@ ke ?
he doesn &apos;t like to wait until the last moment to do something .
remember that .
is that your wife ?
she is was@@ h@@ ing the car .
Tom was a great gu@@ y .
the train is early .
what are you sup@@ pos@@ ed to do ?
she wor@@ ked for a rich man .
Tom nee@@ ds to do that now .
no , just the one .
dro@@ p your g@@ un !
I &apos;m not li@@ k@@ ely to do that again .
do you know where the oth@@ ers are ?
Tom didn &apos;t know how to re@@ act .
they won &apos;t find it .
stay out of the water .
you should &apos;ve turned left .
I st@@ e@@ er@@ ed cl@@ ear of sen@@ si@@ tive to@@ pic@@ s .
N@@ apo@@ le@@ on &apos;s ar@@ my has ad@@ v@@ anc@@ ed to M@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ w .

that kind of ma@@ ch@@ ine is yet to be in@@ v@@ ent@@ ed .
is it an ac@@ tion mo@@ vie ?
he sti@@ c@@ ks to his prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ es .
the T@@ s@@ ar , the gu@@ es@@ ts , the ser@@ v@@ ants , even the gr@@ ay cat s@@ it@@ ting in the cor@@ ner , all were am@@ az@@ ed and won@@ der@@ ed at the beautiful V@@ as@@ i@@ lis@@ sa .

the boy tried mo@@ ving the he@@ av@@ y so@@ f@@ a .
I told them everything .
un@@ less you started lear@@ ning English as a child , you &apos;re un@@ li@@ k@@ ely to ever s@@ ound like a n@@ ati@@ ve spea@@ k@@ er .
it is not so much the he@@ at as the hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty that makes me tired .
bes@@ i@@ des being an ac@@ tr@@ ess , she was a fam@@ ous pain@@ ter .
I &apos;ll go this way .
I am tired of reading .
you are simpl@@ y un@@ be@@ ar@@ able !
what is it this time ?
this is do@@ able .
can you read what that s@@ ays ?
he is just a k@@ id .
there is no re@@ as@@ on for her to s@@ cold you .
I think I know the answ@@ er .
do you remember his tel@@ e@@ phone num@@ ber ?
I still have other things to do .
I &apos;m not a dr@@ un@@ k .

I had a few hours free , so I s@@ at under a t@@ ree and read a book .

I love the s@@ ound of his name .
I &apos;m pl@@ eas@@ ed with his per@@ form@@ ance .
how many stu@@ dents are there in your cl@@ ass ?
it won &apos;t be easy to for@@ get you .
I know Tom is a bit st@@ in@@ g@@ y .
yet Jap@@ an is still not suff@@ ici@@ ent@@ ly under@@ sto@@ od by other coun@@ tri@@ es , and the Jap@@ an@@ ese , li@@ k@@ e@@ wi@@ se , find fo@@ re@@ ign@@ ers difficult to understand .
since he could not work out the problem that way , he tried another way .
anim@@ al@@ s can &apos;t tell what &apos;s re@@ al and what &apos;s f@@ ake .
H@@ er@@ old ag@@ re@@ ed to sur@@ r@@ end@@ er .

I would have bought that car if I &apos;d had the money .
I need su@@ n t@@ an@@ ning lo@@ tion .
the pr@@ ess has been h@@ oun@@ ding the pres@@ i@@ dent n@@ on@@ stop about ren@@ e@@ g@@ ing on his prom@@ ise not to rai@@ se ta@@ x@@ es .
I don &apos;t like trav@@ el@@ ing alone .
that &apos;s what I &apos;m as@@ king you to do .

after the de@@ ath of her parents , An@@ n has been r@@ ais@@ ing her youn@@ ger sister and brother alone .

you &apos;d be the one to know .
sh@@ all I clo@@ se the door ?
I want you to meet my parents .
I can &apos;t stop thin@@ king about that .
that makes a differ@@ ence , doesn &apos;t it ?
having finished the work , he went to bed .
&quot; how old are you ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 1@@ 6 years old . &quot;
did you take it ?
don &apos;t you know his name ?
I must &apos;ve par@@ ked my car el@@ se@@ where .

I &apos;m lu@@ ck@@ y to have you as a friend .
s@@ ever@@ al stu@@ dents in the back of the cl@@ ass@@ room were sle@@ ep@@ ing .

I don &apos;t know where to go or what to do .
what &apos;s the idea ?
I think Tom is aw@@ ake .
