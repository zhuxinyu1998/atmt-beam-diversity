the gre@@ ater the differ@@ ence bet@@ we@@ en the nu@@ ll h@@ y@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is and an out@@ come , and the lar@@ ger the s@@ am@@ ple si@@ ze , the more con@@ fi@@ dent one can be that the out@@ come is me@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ ful .
m@@ ay@@ be Tom has had an accident .
is there any sal@@ t left ?
but the c@@ ase n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess is , that those things der@@ i@@ ve their ori@@ g@@ in from the pro@@ x@@ y@@ s@@ m of the cr@@ u@@ ci@@ fi@@ x@@ ion , and the the@@ ory de@@ du@@ ced th@@ er@@ e@@ from , which was , that one person could stand in the place of another , and could per@@ for@@ m mer@@ it@@ ori@@ ous ser@@ vi@@ ces for him .
you acc@@ used him of having sto@@ l@@ en the bi@@ ke .
this feel@@ s like sil@@ k .
my name &apos;s Tom .
I like the kind of mus@@ ic that Tom pl@@ ays .

this m@@ oun@@ tain is difficult to c@@ li@@ m@@ b .
the boy was cl@@ ever enough to sol@@ ve the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le .
she &apos;s not a good person .
I don &apos;t bl@@ ame you for doing that .
un@@ less I leave right away , I &apos;ll be late for my ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment .
you should have told me that before .
I &apos;m as@@ su@@ ming this is your father .
you were j@@ e@@ al@@ ous .
I never me@@ ant for any of this to happen .
how many k@@ ids do you have ?
why so g@@ lu@@ m ?
he saw a pre@@ tty girl .
you &apos;ll understand it right away .
I w@@ ish I were in Paris now .
will we be in time for the concer@@ t ?
you must &apos;ve been wrong .
let &apos;s dec@@ ide together where to go first .
it was a very good ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence for him .
a question is an answ@@ er .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me he couldn &apos;t speak French .
the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic h@@ it an ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g .
Tom had just one word to cut so that out of this senten@@ ce , fo@@ re@@ ver , dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed our Mary .
I have little inter@@ est in hi@@ story .

you s@@ ound tired .
I &apos;m going to buy a cam@@ era for my d@@ augh@@ ter .
he had a g@@ ent@@ l@@ en@@ ess that was at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive to wom@@ en .
give me the m@@ ic@@ ro@@ phone .
we &apos;re not po@@ or .
if you want that , you can have it .
did Tom tell you where to par@@ k ?
would you like to come to my party ?
it tur@@ n@@ s out that you knew everything but k@@ ep@@ t qui@@ et .
I live in B@@ i@@ a@@ ł@@ y@@ st@@ ok .

he &apos;s no ori@@ g@@ in@@ al thin@@ k@@ er , but simpl@@ y im@@ it@@ ates what oth@@ ers have already said and done .
Tom didn &apos;t do that very much .
stop sho@@ w@@ ing off !
the accident happened at this j@@ un@@ c@@ tion .
that &apos;s not fai@@ r ! you saw my car@@ ds in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r !
I &apos;m ach@@ ing to go to Austr@@ ali@@ a .
I don &apos;t like the t@@ as@@ te of on@@ ions .
he took her in his ar@@ ms .
how did you pu@@ ll it off ?
leave your u@@ m@@ br@@ el@@ la in the h@@ all .
it wasn &apos;t always easy for E@@ di@@ son to in@@ vent new things .
I &apos;m all set .
I &apos;d like to make myself us@@ eful .
I found it in the at@@ ti@@ c .
I have a friend who can speak French .
they sur@@ viv@@ ed , even th@@ ough the bu@@ il@@ ding was des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed .
that &apos;s your du@@ ty .
let me in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce myself .
the book is for me ; the f@@ low@@ ers are for us .
she made me wait for h@@ al@@ f an h@@ our .
you don &apos;t have to answ@@ er .
I can imag@@ ine how you fel@@ t .
the prin@@ c@@ ess &apos;s t@@ as@@ te for plea@@ su@@ res was exp@@ and@@ ing ; and we thought only about how to s@@ prin@@ k@@ le on them new se@@ as@@ on@@ ings , so as to give them more sp@@ ice .
I wasn &apos;t told where we were going .
our o@@ w@@ ner@@ shi@@ p in the comp@@ any is 6@@ 0 % .
that is of no use to me .
I was bor@@ n here .
I &apos;m so@@ re all over .
do not inter@@ f@@ ere !
why do I believe you ?
she may have mis@@ sed the train .
