look !
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what had happened .
no one will stop me .
you don &apos;t have to lie .
M@@ r W@@ il@@ son is pr@@ ou@@ d of his house .
it would be coun@@ ter @-@ produ@@ c@@ tive to do such a thing .
Tom is a ti@@ mi@@ d young man .
I hi@@ d it some@@ where .

J@@ ac@@ ques made it cl@@ ear that he wanted to meet M@@ r G@@ ag@@ non .

I know you see it , but are you really looking at it ?
the bar@@ om@@ et@@ er is fall@@ ing . it is going to rain .
I &apos;m lo@@ ad@@ ed .
I have nothing to f@@ ear .
I don &apos;t know why Tom doesn &apos;t like Boston .
he wor@@ ked for a rich man .
she is h@@ an@@ dic@@ app@@ ed by po@@ or hear@@ ing .
do you think that &apos;s true ?
it mat@@ ters to me .

Tom spea@@ ks French as well as Mary does .
nobody was list@@ en@@ ing to the s@@ pe@@ ec@@ h .

have yourself a drink .
it being S@@ un@@ day , the sho@@ p was clo@@ sed .
he had never can@@ cel@@ ed an ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment before .
that &apos;s a lot of cas@@ h .
what did you do with that ?
you have too many ir@@ ons in the fi@@ re .
some people are reading some mag@@ az@@ in@@ es on the train .
we have no cho@@ ice but to give up the wh@@ ole plan .
eat more ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les .
are you out of your mind ?

Sami has been sick .
the r@@ at was k@@ illed by Tom with a sti@@ ck .
it &apos;s al@@ most hard to believe all these beautiful things were made by hand such a long time ag@@ o .
I &apos;m ta@@ king care of it . you can rel@@ a@@ x . you can r@@ ely on me .
I can &apos;t wal@@ k anymore .
that would make sen@@ se .
he makes himself acc@@ es@@ sible to all who see@@ k his coun@@ se@@ l .
I sle@@ pt n@@ ine hours .
she is P@@ i@@ er@@ ro@@ t &apos;s sister .
Tom likes liv@@ ing in Boston .
he bor@@ ro@@ w@@ ed the car from his friend .
I know it &apos;s wrong , but I &apos;ll do it any@@ way .
we &apos;re ready to leave .
you &apos;re not in a hur@@ ry , are you ?
any of you can do it .
it &apos;s no trou@@ ble at all .
do you think you and I are comp@@ ati@@ ble ?

this book is too lar@@ ge to go in my po@@ ck@@ et .
there &apos;s room in@@ side .
Tom found a job as a me@@ chan@@ ic .

you &apos;d better stay with me .
Tom and Mary have dec@@ i@@ ded to get married in O@@ c@@ to@@ ber .
clo@@ se your eyes and tell me what you hear .

we lost a lot on that job .
spea@@ king of fil@@ ms , why not go to the cin@@ em@@ a ton@@ ight ?
I bought a house .
I lost your phone num@@ ber .

you know what they say .
he re@@ j@@ ected our off@@ er .
do you care for cl@@ as@@ si@@ cal mus@@ ic ?
there &apos;s only one pre@@ tty child in the world , and every mother has it .
it doesn &apos;t matter who s@@ ays that , it &apos;s not true .
H@@ ey , be car@@ eful with that !
are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
