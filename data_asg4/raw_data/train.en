Hello.
I was surprised by the news this morning.
Why do you want to dress like that?
She brushed away the dust.
Keep these rules in mind.
I don't know what's going to happen to you.
His idea looks a lot like mine.
I slept very well last night.
She made him rich.
Don't even bother coming.

What do you think he did?
Excuse me, is there a hotel around here?
The prisoner escaped under cover of night.
They are as strong as us.

I speak Hungarian.
Please give me a cup of water.
Then, when he asked who had broken the window, all the boys acted innocent.

He married a pretty girl.
Run hot water into the bath.
She moved close to him.
We're hungry.
Don't look down on others.
I felt depressed.
My parents are very old fashioned.
Do you know the town where he lives?
We need to get out of here.
Are we mad squirrels?
Allah rocks!
They do it faster than me.
I think it's time for me to stop allowing her to always have her own way.
I'm not any busier today than usual.
Sami used to wear glasses all the time.
I suppose it makes sense to go ahead and pay the bill right now.
I've got nothing to say.
Don't talk to me about him.
I am reading Persian.
You're upset.
Greetings, stranger.
Are you a high school student?
Are you sure we can't repair this camera?

Did you tell Tom he could borrow your car?
Who are you closest to in your family?
Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.
Why did you tell him that?
Tom put too much sugar in my coffee.
Are you ready for Y2K?
She gave me her phone number.

I didn't try to kill anybody.
Do you really think Tom is happy?
Our mother had no choice but to make dinner with leftovers.
The doctor examined over fifty patients that day.
You can't smoke here.
Tom burst out laughing.
I've already read it.

There's really nothing more we can do.
The ceremony was impressive.
You may go.
I appreciate you trying to cheer me up.

I apologize if I offended you.

The contract is in the bag, so let's go out and celebrate.
How much did they give you for your old car?
Sami accidentally ran over Layla.
Ah yes! You understood everything.
Take away this box.
He was afraid that he might hurt her feelings.

You can't hurt my feelings.
We're ready now.
I thought I might never see you again.
These are questions that matter.
He moves quickly.
I have been in Kobe since 1980.
Don't go in that building.
He lived to be seventy years old.
It's my fault, not yours.

Do you want to go in?
He is something of a celebrity.
It's going to be a challenge.
I have pain when urinating.
I've been looking foward to meeting you.
Tom headed for the exit.
Tom! Bring me a sandwich.

I get mad at his arrogance.
Do you want to go to the cinema or the theater?
I remember seeing her.
Tom escaped.
I want a third alternative.
You have to be prepared.
She's not a virgin anymore.
I couldn't find it anywhere.
I feel safe here.
